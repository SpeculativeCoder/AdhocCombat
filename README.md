This is a work in progress...

Got 5 minutes to spare, bored, in Windows and have a Firefox or Chrome based browser? Time for some [_**AdhocCombat**!_](https://adhoccombat.com)

Be assigned to a random faction and fight AI controlled bots and sometimes other players!

Pick from different weapons: Assault Rifle (all round weapon), Shotgun (better at close range), Light Machine Gun (bigger magazine), Marksman Rifle (long range), Grenade Launcher (AOE), or Rocket Launcher (slow firing but big AOE).

Fight for control of objectives on the map. You can only take objectives that are linked to an objective you already own (but if your faction has no objectives - you can take any objective).
